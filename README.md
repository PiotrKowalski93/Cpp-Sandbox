### List vs Vector

1 Element:
vector.push_back() = 6
list.push_back() = 1

100 Elements:
vector.push_back() = 17
list.push_back() = 48

1 Element:
vector.insert() = 3
list.push_front() = 0

100 Elements:
vector.insert() = 52
list.push_front() = 23

300 Elements Iteration:
vector = 5
list = 81

Collection size: 100 000 | Operations: 50 000
list = 72064234
vector = 1214935
